# 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent payment transactions using machine learning and data visualization. By analyzing transaction logs, the project applies classification models to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent payments. Additionally, it provides visual insights into fraud patterns and risk indicators.

The objectives are:
- Build predictive models for fraud detection.
- Explore data visualizations to uncover hidden fraud patterns.
- Evaluate model performance to balance accuracy and recall (minimizing false negatives).

# ⚙️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas / NumPy – Data preprocessing and feature transformation.
- Scikit-learn – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, evaluation metrics.
- XGBoost – Gradient boosting classifier for fraud detection.
- Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization (class distribution, feature analysis, confusion matrix).

# 📝 Keynotes

- Preprocessed payment transaction data, handling missing values and preparing features for modeling.

- Built and compared multiple classification models, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - XGBoost Classifier

- Evaluated models using key performance metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - ROC-AUC score

- Visualized fraud detection insights through:
  - Transaction amount distributions (fraud vs. legitimate)
  - Correlation heatmaps of transaction features
  - Feature importance rankings (tree-based models)
  - Confusion matrices for model performance interpretation

# 🚀 Future Improvements

- Implement deep learning models (LSTM, Autoencoders) for sequential fraud detection.
- Apply real-time streaming detection with Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis.
- Enhance feature engineering by incorporating behavioral features (frequency, velocity of transactions).
- Deploy the fraud detection system as an interactive dashboard or API.
- Use explainable AI (XAI) methods to interpret fraud classification decisions.
